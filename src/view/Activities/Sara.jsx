                This tour was exceptionally well organized. Directions were
                perfect, the bus was extremely comfortable, Isabelle our guide
                was knowledgeable and friendly, making the experience so much
                more meaningful. I visited Versailles 25 years ago and learned
                so much more this time. Having this private tour also helped us
                relax after a trying day navigating around the strikes around
                Paris on March 15. I canâ€™t recommend this enough - no line,
                comfortable transportation so you can nap to and from. Tip:
                Angelina Cafe is in Versailles. You can skip the long line for
                the dining room and just get sandwiches and beverages -
                including the famous hot chocolate - and then go eat in the
                garden outside. What a beautiful and relaxing experience. The
                goat cheese and honey sandwich has spinach and is on a sesame
                baguette. So delicious!

                                    This tour was exceptionally well organized. Directions were perfect,
                                    the bus was extremely comfortable, Isabelle our guide was
                                    knowledgeable and friendly, making the experience so much more
                                    meaningful. I visited Versailles 25 years ago and learned so much
                                    more this time. Having this private tour also helped us relax after
                                    a trying day navigating around the strikes around Paris on March 15.
                                    I canâ€™t recommend this enough - no line, comfortable transportation
                                    so you can nap to and from. Tip: Angelina Cafe is in Versailles. You
                                    can skip the long line for the dining room and just get sandwiches
                                    and beverages - including the famous hot chocolate - and then go eat
                                    in the garden outside. What a beautiful and relaxing experience. The
                                    goat cheese and honey sandwich has spinach and is on a sesame
                                    baguette. So delicious!

                                    Julien was our guide and he was amazing! The tour was so much fun!
                                    It was the first thing we did after landing and a great jump start
                                    to seeing the city! Highly recommend! Julien knew all of the stops
                                    to take great photos of us!
